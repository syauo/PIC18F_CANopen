** OBJECT TYPES ****************************************************************
   0  NULL        A dictionary entry with no data fields.
   2  DOMAIN      Large variable amount of data e.g. executable program code.
   5  DEFTYPE     Denotes a type definition such as a Boolean, UNSIGNED16, float and so on.
   6  DEFSTRUCT   Defines a new record type e.g. the PDOMapping structure at 21h.
   7  VAR         A single value such as an UNSIGNED8, Boolean, float, Integer16, visible string etc.
   8  ARRAY       A multiple data field object where each data field is a simple variable
                  of the SAME basic data type e.g. array of UNSIGNED16 etc. Sub-index 0 is
                  of UNSIGNED8 and therefore not part of the ARRAY data.
   9  RECORD      A multiple data field object where the data fields may be any combination of simple
                  variables. Sub-index 0 is of UNSIGNED8 and therefore not part of the RECORD data.

* SDO or PDO Parameters: If COB ID needs to be changed, first bit 31 must be set to 1 to disable SDO (PDO),
  then ID can be changed and then SDO (PDO) can be enabled by seting bit 31 back to 0 (CiA DS-301).
